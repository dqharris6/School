NOTE:  Please follow your lab instructor's directions for submitting
your assignment through CSNET.  (Use VPN if you are off campus.)  ONLY 
ASSIGNMENTS SUBMITTED TO CSNET WILL BE GRADED!  Make a printout of each source 
file and staple it behind this cover sheet, unless your lab instructor directs 
otherwise.  Sign it and give it to your TA in lab or put it in your TA's 
mailbox in the corner of the 3rd floor of HRBB, near room 312.  IF YOU DO NOT 
TURN IN A SIGNED COVER SHEET YOUR WORK WILL NOT BE GRADED!

NOTE:  Homework will be graded on build.cse.tamu.edu using g++ version 4.9.
You are free to develop your programs on Visual C++ or any other platform, 
but it is your responsibility to make sure your programs also compile and
execute correctly on build.cse.tamu.edu using g++ version 4.9.

NOTE:  Each file submitted (hw2pr1.cpp, etc.--see below) must begin as follows:
//Your Name
//Course and section number
//Due: September 21, 2014 (or whatever the due date is)
//hw2pr1.cpp (or whatever this file name is)

The grade for this lab will be based on style (formatting, variable
names, comments, etc.), syntax (no compilation or link errors), and
correctness (passes all test cases).  Your grade for this lab is:

Problem #       1       2       3       4 
Style           /2      /4      /4      /2 
Syntax          /3      /6      /6      /3 
Correctness     /5      /10     /10     /5

1. (10 points)  Wednesday, September 17th, is Constitution Day in the U.S.  
Look up the Bill of Rights (first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution) and
write a program to ask the user for a number (1 to 10) and print out a 
brief description of that amendment.  A sample run should look like this:

Which amendment? 1
Amendment 1 guarantees freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, and
petition.

Which amendment? 77
That is not a valid input.  Please enter a number between 1 and 10.

Which amendment? 7
Amendment 7 guarantees trial by jury.

Do not use vectors in this program. Name your program hw2pr1.cpp.

2. (20 points)  Rewrite problem 1 to use a vector to store the answers, so
that answers[i] contains the answer for the ith amendment.  Name your program 
hw2pr2.cpp. vector <string> nameofstring;

3. (20 points)  One financial planner recommends dividing your income into the 
following budget categories:
	give away 10% (e.g., to some cause you are committed to, or to help
		others)
	save 10% (e.g., for unexpected expenses or planned large purchases)
	live on 80%

Write a program named hw2pr3.cpp which repeatedly asks for an income amount in
dollars and prints out the budget amounts in dollars and cents.  A sample run 
should look like this:

Income in dollars? 1000
You should give away $100.00, save $100.00, and live on $800.00.

Income in dollars? 2014
You should give away $201.40, save $201.40, and live on $1611.20.

Hint:  Look up setprecision, so your program doesn't print $201.4.

OPTIONAL EXTRA CREDIT 
=====================
4. (10 points)  Rewrite hw1pr3 to use two vectors, one for the denominations
in pence and one for the quantities read in.  For example,
     vector<int> denomination{1,2,...,500};

Hint: Use an if statement so that if the denomination is 100 pence or more the
program asks how many xxx-pound coins you have (divide pence by 100).

Name your program hw2pr4.cpp.
